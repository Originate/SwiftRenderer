# SwiftRenderer
3D Rendering in Swift. Practice Swift, practice 3D rendering.

Created this project because value type in Swift is a great fit to math primitives and operations in 3D rendering, with efficient memory allocation for new and copied values.

## Next

- Figure out the first rendering feature using Swift 5.0
